Before I jump into writing about my Home Server environment, I thought I would do a bit of a write up on how I created (and will maintain) this site. Using a technique I'm calling "Blog-as-Code". To achieve this I use a number of awesome tools and projects to manage, generate, and host this site (for FREE 😍).

> I write these articles in a follow along style, so that hopefully you can create or re-use aspects of what I write about in your own environment.
{: .prompt-info }

So lets break down the different components:

* [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator that transforms plain text into beautiful static websites and blogs, and is the foundation of our "blog-as-code" approach. Turning the [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files we use to write articles, into webpages like you're reading now.

* [**Chirpy**](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) an awesome text-focused theme for Jekyll created by [Cotes Chung](https://github.com/cotes2020). Or more specifically his amazing [Chirpy Starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) template that automates the creation and updates of our site going forward using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) our first foray into the CI/CD world using GitHub.

* [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/) and an underlying Github repo we will use to store and host everything related to our site.

* [**Giscus**](https://giscus.app/) is a comments system powered by [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions), that allows visitors to leave comments and reactions to aritcles (all stored in our same GitHub repo!)

Okay so there's a few moving parts, but don't stress thanks to [Cotes](https://github.com/cotes2020) we will be up and running pretty quickly, and only have to edit a few files to get use started.

So let's being creating our "Blog-as-Code" site.

# STEP 1: Chirpy Starter

To quickly get things up and running we are going to use the awesome (I have to say it again!) [Chirpy Starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) template. This will automagically create a new GitHub repo based on the Chirpy Starter template.

> So before you start make sure you have your own GitHub account setup
{: .prompt-tip }

This tempalte includes everything will need (Jekyll, Chirpy theme, GitHub Action etc).

1. Sign in to GitHub, and browse to [Chirpy Starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter/generate).

2. Click <kbd>Use this template</kbd> > <kbd>Create a new repository</kbd>, in the top right

    ![Chirpy Starter Template](/assets/articles/2024-01-13-chirpystarter.png)
    _Creating a new GitHub repo using the Chirpy Starter template

3. Name the new repo `USERNAME.github.io`, where `USERNAME` represents our GitHub username.

4. We are going to set the access permissions to **Public** as we are going to hose our site using GitHub Pages.

> GitHub Pages is available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "GitHub’s plans."
{: .prompt-info }

4. Click <kbd>Create repository</kbd>


> For more information about Chirpy Starter template, checkout the doc's [here](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter?tab=readme-ov-file)
{: .prompt-info }

We now have the basis of our "Blog-as-Code" site.

# STEP 2: Configure it

Before we jump into updating the content of our site. We need to update several files that control the sites configuration.

These files are:

* **/_config.yml** - the main configuration file for our Chirpy theme'd Jekyll site
* **/_data/contact.yml** - manages the contact options displayed at the bottom of the sidebar
* **/_data/share.yml** - manages what platforms visitors can share our articles to

> I use VSCode for the Web (http://vscode.dev) as my IDE to work on GitHub repo's. You can use VSCode for the Web from any modern web browser, to easily access your GitHub repos to bulk edit files and commit changes back to your repo. Check out this quick intro video to [VSCode for the Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdNipVZK53A)
{: .prompt-tip }

## _config.yml

This is the main configuration file for the site. This has a number of variables we want to update to make the site our own. 

>1. Use the included comments (pre-fixed with '#') to guide you through making the required changes to the _config.yml file. 
>
>2. We can use the same '#' pre-fix to comment / uncomment lines we don't wan't to use / include in our configuration (e.g. social links). This is a better approach then simply deleting options from the file, as we may want to use them in the future.
{: .prompt-tip }

The following is an extract of my */_config.yml* file from my setup:

```yaml
lang: en
timezone: Pacific/Auckland
title: O so techie
tagline: Technical Specialist | Smart Home Enthusiast | Full Time Tinkerer | 🇳🇿  
description: >- 
  The ramblings of my adventures into all things technical, both from a personal and work life perspecitve. Expect everything from topics about Smart Home Automation and Home Labbing, to DevOps and AI (all personal interests) to more work related content around evertyhing Microsoft.

```
{: file="/_config.yml" }

> There are a few more variables we will update later once we have everything setup.
{: .prompt-info }

## _data/contact.yml

This file controls which contact options are displayed at the bottom of the left sidebar of our site. 

The following is an example of my */_data/contact.yml* file from my setup:

```yaml
- type: github
  icon: "fab fa-github"
- type: twitter
  icon: "fa-brands fa-x-twitter"
- type: linkedin
  icon: 'fab fa-linkedin'  
  url: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/owendemooy'
- type: rss
  icon: "fas fa-rss"
  noblank: true
```
{: file="/_data/contact.yml" }

> YAML Files can be a bit of fun syntax wise, so make sure you have the right tabbing and syntax structure. Otherwise the GitHub Action that generates our sites content will fail (more on this later), like it did for me at first.
{: .prompt-warning }

## _data/share.yml

This file controls what platforms visitors can share your articles to. 

The following is an example of my */_data/contact.yml* file from my setup:

```yaml
platforms:
  - type: Twitter
    icon: "fa-brands fa-square-x-twitter"
    link: "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=TITLE&url=URL"

  - type: Facebook
    icon: "fab fa-facebook-square"
    link: "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=TITLE&u=URL"

  - type: Linkedin
    icon: "fab fa-linkedin"
    link: "https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=URL"
```
{: file="/_data/share.yml" }

# Personalise It

So we've configured our site, now its time to add our own personal falvour. Okay okay we already personalised it a bit in the previous step (I know 😁). 

Now we are going to actually update the sites content, and add our own imagery. To do this we are going to do the following

1. Add our own Avatar or the hero image at the top of the left side bar
2. Create our own Favicons (based on our Avatar)
3. Update the About page so people know what our site is all about

## Add our own Avatar

So our site needs an Avatar (or Hero Image) to give it some identity. How you choose to create your own Avatar it up to you.

>Make sure your avatar image is a 512 x 512 (1:1 ratio) so it displays correctly. This will also help with the next step where we use this to also create our favicons.
{: .prompt-tip }

*I used a bit of Microsoft CoPilot prompt magic to generate my own Avatar when I started the 'O so techie' journey. I use this across my site, GitHub account, and as such will be referencing my GitHub Account Avatar URL for this step.*

If you aren't linking to your Avatar image to your GitHub account or another Social platform. I would suggest uploading the image to '/assets/avatar.png' for example so you can easily reference it.

Now we have our Avatar its time to update our site details, for this we will update the */_config.yml*:

```yaml
avatar: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34251619?s=400&u=4569cab1b4280e33839357542cf31b8bbc19b2fc&v=4
```
{: file="/_config.yml" }

>If you are storing the image in your GitHub repo, remember to set the avatar value to '/assets/avatar.png' for example.
{: .prompt-tip }

## Create our own Favicons

Okay so when I first did this I missed this step, and wondered why when I shared my site with others, or looked at the browsers tab icon for my site it was a default chirpy icon.

Well it turns out we have to generate our own Favicons, thankfully this is not as hard as it sounds, and we can use our Avatar as the source image.

To make this whole process easier we are going to use this handy tool [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to create all the required files (and a few more that we don't need).

>The Generator needs a source image that is at least 512 x 512 to generate all the different favicon files we need
{: .prompt-tip }

1. Browse to [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)

        ![Real Favicon Generator](/assets/articles/2024-01-13-realfavicongenerator.png)
        _Create your Favicons using Real Favicon Generator

2. Click <kbd>Select your Favicon image</kbd> to upload your image

3. Accept the deafult usage scenarios, and scroll to the bottom of the page

4. Click <kbd>Generate your Favicons and HTML code</kbd>

5. Click <kbd>Favicon Package</kbd> to download the generated favicons

6. Extract the contents of the download, and remove the following files

    - `browserconfig.xml`{: .filepath}
    - `site.webmanifest`{: .filepath}

7. Upload the remaining files to our GitHub repo to replace the original files in the direcotry '/assets/img/favicons/' (if the directory doesn't exist just create it).

## Tell them About our site

Lets tell people a little about ourselves and our site. To do this we are going to start writting our first markdown. As the about page content is stored in its own markdown file */_tabs/about.md*.

>Want to learn the basics of writting mardown, check out the markdown guide [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
{: .prompt-tip }

The following is an example of my */_tab/about.md* file from my setup:

```markdown
---
# the default layout is 'page'
icon: fas fa-info-circle
order: 4
---

# 👋 Hi!

I'm Owen de Mooy (aka O), a techie and full time tinkerer at heart. I'm trying my hand at sharing my own tech journey through this site. I enjoy the ever-changing way technology can be used both personally and professionally to enhance our lives.

I have been following a number of people, groups and organisations across social platforms for years that have inspired my own growth and want this site to be a way of paying it forward. I am a strong believe in sharing my learnings with others in my team, customers, and industry peers as it helps drive collective growth, and hope this will provide another outlet to continue that growth both personally and collectively with you all.

The following is just some of the wide range of topics I hope to discuss and cover.

* Smart home tech and gadgets
* Home Automation
* HomeLab
* DevOps
* Artificial Intelligence
* Modern Work + Security <i>(some more work related content)</i>
```

# STEP 3 - Enable GitHub Pages

Before we close out this first part of our "blog-as-code" series, we will enable GitHub Pages and the GitHub Action so Jekyll can automatically generate the static site content GitHub Pages will present our visitors.

>I'm not sure if this was just an issue for me, but when I ran through this process GitHub Pages was not properly enabled on my repo. So I had to do the below to enable it.
{: .prompt-info }

1. Open our GitHub Repo Settings

2. Select *Pages* from the settings page

3. Change the Build and Deploy *Source* to *GitHub Actions*

Now when we commit changes to our repo, the GitHub Action will automatically run and re-generate our site content. If the action fails for any reason (like it did for me, because nothing works the first time right 😉) you can check out the logs under the Actions tab in your GitHub repo.
